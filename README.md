# Klab-mobile-app
# In this Repository I have created a mobile app as a challenge that I have been assigned during my Apprenticeship At Klab.
## Purpose
To increase the efficiency of kLab attendees. We’d provide users with the opportunity to book
time slots for members, remind them of upcoming events to help with forward planning,
companies to give projects and find hard-working people to help work on them and for the
app users themselves to start projects of their own. Users would also get the opportunity to
find people who share the same interest as them and build strong relationships with fellow techies. Intended Audience

## The app is intended
● for parents who’d like to enroll their children in programs in advance,
● companies who have projects that need to be worked on,
● internationals who plan on visiting Rwanda,
● Graduates who’d like to venture into something new or even gain new experience, and
● members who’d just like to use the space.

## Intended Use
When downloaded users are then asked to register themselves or a child. They can then
answer a quick survey detailing what they are looking for specifically or skip the survey if
they don't have a general idea. After all this, they can register for upcoming events, get
notified in advance when events are coming up, join projects, give projects, or even start their
own. Graduates and children can register for programs like future coders, and parents can
track their progress. In the case of private mentoring, parents have a variety of people who’d
be willing to teach these children everything they’d need to know. Members can register for a
membership and use the space and even notify in advance when we’ll be expecting them.
They’d get Qr codes to sign themselves in upon arrival.
